### Hi there 👋

I'm an IT production operations manager with a passion for data! 🔭 I’m currently working on growing my skills as a data analyst/scientist. 🌱 I have enjoyed learning Python, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas Matplotlib 📊 and API Interactions. Within my repositories I have applied modeling and forecasting statistics to analyse the data. I'm formiluar with PostgresSQL/pgAdmin, MongoDB, and ETL. I have utilizied HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, dashboarding, JavaScript charting 📈, and Geomapping with Leaflet.js, PowerBI, and Tableau to visualize the data. I am exposed to but in the early stages of learning with R Programming, Big Data Analytics with Hadoop, Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning, as well as Deep Learning.  I have a intermediate knowledge of Excel since the world seems to love pivot tables and VBA Scripting.  With all of that said sometimes I feel as if I've forgotten as much as I've learned but continue to remind myself that building your skillset takes 🕓 and that I need to pace myself.  Life is a journey not a destination. 

⚡ Fun fact: 
I enjoy ⛺ camping, trout fishing, and build my 4x4, ✈ travel, and 🏋working out.
